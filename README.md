# 🌟 Learn C++ Sandbox 🚀

Welcome to my personal playground for mastering C++! This repository is a structured workspace for following along with the awesome tutorials at [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/). 🎓💻

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository is designed to track my progress through the [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) tutorials. Each chapter is neatly organized, and the project is set up for easy building and exploration.

- **Purpose**: Practice and master C++ concepts through hands-on coding.
- **Structure**: Organized by chapters with clear naming conventions.
- **Tools**: Built using CMake for flexibility and compatibility with IDEs like JetBrains Rider.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is organized to make navigation a breeze! 🌈

- **Chapters**: Each chapter from learncpp.com is housed in its own directory under `chapters/`.
  - Format: `chapters/##_##_<ShortTitle>` (e.g., `chapters/01_02_HelloWorld`).
  - Each chapter contains source code, exercises, and notes specific to that topic.

- **Root Directory**:
  - `CMakeLists.txt`: Build the entire project using CMake.
  - Open the project directly in JetBrains Rider for a seamless development experience.
